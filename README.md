# Byte-to-Bit-Bit-to-Byte
This is a simple code in C for make a decompose a binary  number (byte) in bits and remake a byte with this bits.
I made this to study and to use in my study of PIC with UART.
I used this ['website'](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler#) for made and test this code.
